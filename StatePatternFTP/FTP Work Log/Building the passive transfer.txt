Test that a users's username is used by all loggers after it has been entered.
Refactor the logger which states that a user has entered a username.
	Perhaps delegate this to the login authentication process. Log something after the user has logged in.
Build logic to verify if a command has the correct number of arguements
	501 Syntax error in parameters or arguments.
Refactor each state so that the ClientSesion is injected during instantiation.
	
	
Implement LIST command
	Sends a list from the server to the passive DTP (Data Transfer Process)
	
	
	
	
Passive - Server listens on IP and port specified by PORT (or the default IP and port)
	Server opens a port (N > 1023)
Active - Client listens on IP and port specified by PORT (or the default IP and port)

Command
	PASV - Server opens up on a data port. Response is the data port (format?).
Passive steps
	Client contacts server (on server's port 21).	(Done)
	Client issues PASV command.					(In Progress)
		Server picks a port (50,000 <= P <= 65,535)			
	Server responds to PASV command with P which it begins listneing to for the data connection.	(Not done)
	Client connects to the servers data port.											(Not done)
	The server detects the connection and responds by sending the requested data down it.	(Not done)
	
Server process port (aka L) = 21
Passive server data port P > 1023
Passive client ports. Cmd is N > 1023, Data is N+1
Unprivileged port range is 1024 - 65,535
Full port range 1 to 65,535
FileZilla recommends P >= 50,000
p1 = (P - p2)/256

PASV response codes
	227 Entering Passive Mode (h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2).
	501 Syntax error in parameters or arguments.

p1 = (P - p2)/256

256p1 = P - p2

p2 + 256p1 = P
